                  # python-random-number-generator-                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                              
Certainly! Here's an explanation of each line of code:                                                                                                                              
                                                      
1. `import random`: This line imports the `random` module in Python. Modules are files containing Python definitions and statements. The `random` module provides various functions for generating random numbers and performing random selections.                              

2. `random_number = random.randint(1, 100)`: In this line, the `randint(a, b)` function from the `random` module is used to generate a random integer. The `randint()` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`. In this case, it generates a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and assigns it to the variable `random_number`.
        
3. `print("Random Number:", random_number)`: This line uses the `print()` function to display the generated random number. The `print()` function is used to output text or variables to the console. In this case, it prints the string "Random Number:" followed by the value stored in the `random_number` variable.

When you run this code, it will output a random integer between 1 and 100, which is generated by the `random.randint(1, 100)` function call.      
   
remember to install python and the necessary extensions for the programm to run
